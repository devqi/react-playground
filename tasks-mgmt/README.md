##### Prerequisites: nodejs, npm, yarn are already installed.

##### Create necessary files for the projects:
- **yarn init** or **npm init** => generate package.json which includes basic information, such as name, version, author, license, etc.
- create a folder named **public** and add a file named **index.html** under it.
- create a folder named **src** and add a file named **index.js** under it.
- [optional] set up a web server **live-server** by using **yarn add [global] live-server** or **npm install [-g] live-server**.
- set up Babel: run **yarn add babel-preset-react babel-preset-env** to add these two to the dependency-list in package.json. Meanwhile, **node_modules** and **yarn.lock** are added.
